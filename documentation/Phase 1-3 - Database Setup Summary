# Phase 1.3: Database Setup Summary

This document summarizes the key activities and outcomes of Phase 1.3 for the kollector-scrum project.

## Goals
- Integrate a PostgreSQL database with the backend API.
- Set up Entity Framework Core for data access and migrations.
- Establish a foundation for future data modeling and persistence.

## Tasks Completed
- **Installed PostgreSQL locally** and verified connectivity.
- **Added Entity Framework Core and Npgsql provider** to the backend project.
- **Created and configured the database context** (`KollectorScrumDbContext`) for PostgreSQL.
- **Added connection strings** to `appsettings.json` and `appsettings.Development.json`.
- **Configured Entity Framework Core in the DI container** in `Program.cs`.
- **Set up database migrations infrastructure** for schema evolution.
- **Created and applied the initial migration** to generate the base database schema.

## Outcomes
- The backend API is now connected to a local PostgreSQL database.
- Entity Framework Core is fully configured for code-first migrations and data access.
- The initial database schema is in place, ready for further model development.

## Next Steps
- Proceed to frontend project setup (Phase 1.4).
- Begin implementing core data models and lookup tables in subsequent phases.
