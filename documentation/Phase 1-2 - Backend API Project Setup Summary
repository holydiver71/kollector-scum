# Phase 1.2: Backend API Project Setup Summary

This document summarizes the key activities and outcomes of Phase 1.2 for the kollector-scrum project.

## Goals
- Scaffold a robust, testable ASP.NET Core Web API backend following Clean Architecture and SOLID principles.
- Establish a maintainable structure for future feature development and integration.

## Tasks Completed
- **Created ASP.NET Core Web API project** using .NET 8.
- **Configured project structure** with folders for Controllers, Models, Services, and Data.
- **Set up dependency injection container** for service management and loose coupling.
- **Configured logging and error handling middleware** to ensure robust diagnostics and graceful error responses.
- **Added Swagger/OpenAPI documentation** for interactive API exploration and documentation.
- **Created a basic health check endpoint** to verify API availability and support monitoring.

## Outcomes
- The backend API is scaffolded and running locally.
- Project structure supports Clean Architecture and future extensibility.
- Health check endpoint and Swagger UI are accessible for testing and documentation.
- Logging and error handling are in place for easier debugging and maintenance.

## Next Steps
- Proceed to database setup and integration (Phase 1.3).
- Begin implementing core data models and API endpoints in subsequent phases.
