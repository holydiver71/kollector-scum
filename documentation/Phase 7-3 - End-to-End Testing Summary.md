   - Or start manually before running tests

3. **Playwright Browsers Installed**
   ```bash
   npx playwright install
   ```

## Integration with CI/CD

### GitHub Actions Ready
The Playwright configuration is CI-ready with:
- Retry logic for flaky tests
- Single worker on CI
- Failure artifacts (screenshots, videos, traces)
- HTML reporter for test results

### Example CI Configuration
```yaml
- name: Install Playwright Browsers
  run: npx playwright install --with-deps

- name: Run Playwright tests
  run: npm run test:e2e
  
- name: Upload test results
  if: always()
  uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
  with:
    name: playwright-report
    path: playwright-report/
```
