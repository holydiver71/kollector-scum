## History
This is a music collection app born of an obsession to manage my music collection my way. I'm an old fashioned software engineer, out of the game for 10+ years and figuring out how to develop a modern web application using AI (github co-pilot is my friend here) while learning the basic of the technologies listed above. Wish me luck...
