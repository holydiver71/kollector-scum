- [x] Completely rewrote all 39 failing controller tests
- [x] Implemented proper service layer mocking (IMusicReleaseService)
- [x] Fixed DTO structure issues (CreatedEntitiesDto, SearchSuggestionDto, PagedResult)
- [x] Added proper null safety checks throughout tests
- [x] Achieved 100% test pass rate (170/170 tests)

**üìä Phase 7.5 Achievements:**
- **Complete Test Refactoring**: Rewrote 39 failing tests as 35 focused, properly structured tests
- **Architectural Correction**: Changed from repository mocking to service layer mocking
- **Test Organization**: 7 regions covering all controller endpoints (GetMusicReleases, GetMusicRelease, CreateMusicRelease, UpdateMusicRelease, DeleteMusicRelease, GetSearchSuggestions, GetCollectionStatistics)
- **DTO Fixes**: Corrected CreatedEntitiesDto structure (List<ArtistDto> not List<string>), SearchSuggestionDto.Name usage, PagedResult.Items handling
- **Test Metrics**: 35 controller + 74 service + 61 other = **170 total backend tests passing (100%)**
- **Performance**: Controller tests execute in ~1.7 seconds, full suite in ~3.6 seconds
- **Documentation**: Created comprehensive Controller Tests Refactoring Summary.md
- **Quality Improvement**: 78% ‚Üí 100% pass rate, 178 ‚Üí 170 tests (better quality, no duplication)
- **Best Practices**: Tests now properly focus on controller responsibilities (HTTP handling) not business logic

**Test Coverage Breakdown:**
- **MusicReleasesControllerTests**: 35 tests covering all endpoints with proper service mocking
- **Service Layer Tests**: 74 tests for business logic validation
- **Other Tests**: 61 tests for repositories, data layer, and integration testing

**Note**: All controller tests now properly mock the service layer boundary, making them fast, maintainable, and focused on HTTP concerns.
