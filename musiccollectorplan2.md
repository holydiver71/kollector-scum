# kollector-scrum Project Plan

This plan outlines the phased development of the kollector-scrum web application using C# .NET backend, Next.js frontend, PostgreSQL database, xUnit testing, and Playwright e2e testing. kollector-scum is a music collection web app used to catalogue a users music collection.

## Notes and Guidelines
- Each phase should result in a working, testable application
- All code should be committed to GitHub at the end of each task, each new phase a new branch.
- Follow SOLID principles throughout development
- Maintain high code coverage with meaningful tests
- Regular code reviews and refactoring sessions
- Update this plan as new requirements emerge
- Produce and maintain documentation throughout development of this app
- Add comments for all classes and methods.
- Swagger documentation to be produced as appropriate
- tick off steps and phases in this plan when completed.
- Follow security best practices and implement measures to counteract OWASP top 10
