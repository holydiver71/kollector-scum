# Add Release Functionality Implementation Plan

## Overview
Implementation of functionality to add new music releases to the collection via two methods:
1. **Manual Data Entry**: Complete form-based data entry
2. **Discogs API Lookup**: Automated data retrieval from Discogs API by catalog number

**Key Feature**: Automatic creation of new lookup entities (artists, labels, genres) when not present in database. User reviews and confirms before submission.

**Branch**: `feature/add-release`  
**Start Date**: October 18, 2025  
**Last Updated**: October 20, 2025  
**Status**: Phase 2 (Backend) Complete ✅ - All backend functionality implemented and tested

**Test Status**: 
- 10/10 MusicReleaseService UpdateMusicRelease tests passing ✅
- 64/64 CreateMusicRelease and Discogs integration tests passing ✅
- Total: 74 section 2.3 tests passing ✅
- Note: 39 MusicReleasesController tests failing (pre-existing issue, not related to section 2.3 work)

---

## Critical Workflow: Handling New Lookup Entities

When adding a release from Discogs (or manual entry), new artists/labels/genres/countries/formats/packaging may not exist in the database:

1. **User Action**: Search Discogs or enter data manually
2. **System Detection**: Identify which lookup entities are new (not in DB)
   - Artists, Labels, Genres, Countries, Formats, Packaging
3. **Preview & Highlight**: Show user what will be created 
   - Example: "This will create: 2 new artists, 1 new label, 1 new country"
4. **User Confirmation**: User reviews and confirms creation
5. **Atomic Creation**: Backend creates new lookup entities + release in single transaction
6. **Purchase Info Prompt (Optional)**: After release created, prompt for purchase information
   - User can "Skip for Now" or "Add Purchase Info"
   - If adding: collect store, price, currency, date, notes
   - Can create new store if not in list
   - Updates release with PATCH request
7. **Success Feedback**: "Release added + created 2 new artists, 1 new label, 1 new country"
   - If purchase info added: "Release added! Purchase info saved."

This ensures:
- No orphaned or invalid foreign key references
- User knows exactly what's being added to the database
- Duplicate detection (case-insensitive matching for all lookup types)
- Transaction safety (all-or-nothing)
- Low-friction workflow (purchase info is optional)

**Lookup Types with Auto-Creation:**
- ✅ Artists (from Discogs or manual)
- ✅ Labels (from Discogs or manual)
- ✅ Genres (from Discogs or manual)
- ✅ Countries (from Discogs or manual)
- ✅ Formats (from Discogs or manual)
- ✅ Packaging (from Discogs or manual)
- ⚠️ Stores (manual entry only, not from Discogs, created during purchase info step)

## Notes and Considerations

### Discogs API Notes
- **Rate Limits**: Discogs API has rate limits (typically 60 requests/minute for authenticated requests)
- **Authentication**: May require user token or OAuth for some operations
- **Data Quality**: Crowd-sourced data may have inconsistencies
- **Coverage**: Very new or rare releases might not be available
- **Catalog Numbers**: Can be ambiguous and return multiple variants

### Technical Considerations
- **Image Handling**: Decide whether to store Discogs image URLs or download/host images
- **Lookup Data**: May need to create new artists, labels, genres on-the-fly
- **Data Mapping**: Not all Discogs fields map 1:1 to our schema
- **Validation**: Balance between strict validation and user flexibility
- **Error Recovery**: Users should be able to save data even if Discogs lookup fails

### Auto-Creation of Lookup Entities Strategy

When a user adds a release from Discogs or manual entry with new artists/labels/genres:

**Backend Approach:**
1. **Modified CreateMusicReleaseDto**: Support both ID-based and name-based data
   ```csharp
   // Can provide either artistIds OR artistNames (or both)
   public List<int>? ArtistIds { get; set; }
   public List<string>? ArtistNames { get; set; }  // NEW
   
   public int? LabelId { get; set; }
   public string? LabelName { get; set; }          // NEW (in addition to LabelId)
   
   public List<int>? GenreIds { get; set; }
   public List<string>? GenreNames { get; set; }   // NEW
   
   public int? CountryId { get; set; }
   public string? CountryName { get; set; }        // NEW
   
   public int? FormatId { get; set; }
   public string? FormatName { get; set; }         // NEW
   
   public int? PackagingId { get; set; }
   public string? PackagingName { get; set; }      // NEW
   ```

2. **Lookup Resolution Logic** (in CreateMusicRelease endpoint):
   - For each lookup type (Artists, Labels, Genres, Countries, Formats, Packaging):
     - If Name(s) provided, resolve or create:
       - Check if entity exists (case-insensitive)
       - If exists, use existing ID
       - If not, create new entity, get ID
   - Store resolved IDs in appropriate fields
   - Same logic for all lookup types

3. **Transaction Safety**:
   - Use UnitOfWork transaction
   - Create all new lookup entities first
   - Then create MusicRelease with resolved IDs
   - Rollback everything if any step fails

4. **Return Enhanced Response**:
   ```json
   {
     "release": { /* created release */ },
     "created": {
       "artists": [{ "id": 123, "name": "New Artist" }],
       "labels": [{ "id": 45, "name": "New Label" }],
       "genres": [{ "id": 12, "name": "New Genre" }],
       "countries": [{ "id": 78, "name": "New Country" }],
       "formats": [{ "id": 9, "name": "New Format" }],
       "packagings": []
     }
   }
   ```

**Frontend Approach:**
1. **Combo-box/Autocomplete Components**: Allow typing new values
2. **Preview Before Submit**: Show "Will create 2 new artists, 1 new label, 1 new country"
3. **Confirmation Dialog**: User explicitly confirms creation
4. **Success Message**: "Added release + created 2 new artists, 1 new label, 1 new country"

**Database Constraints:**
- Unique constraints on Artist.Name, Label.Name, Genre.Name, Country.Name, Format.Name, Packaging.Name (case-insensitive)
- Prevents duplicates even with concurrent requests

**Note on Stores:**
- Stores are only used for purchase info (manual entry)
- Not retrieved from Discogs
- Can optionally support new store creation in manual entry flow

### Purchase Information Two-Step Workflow

Purchase information is collected **after** release creation, not during:

**Why Two-Step?**
1. Discogs doesn't provide purchase information
2. User may not have purchase details readily available
3. Reduces friction in the main release creation flow
4. Purchase info is optional metadata, not core release data

**Frontend Flow:**
1. User adds release from Discogs or manual entry
2. Release is created in database
3. **Modal/Dialog appears:** "Add Purchase Information?"
   - Option A: "Skip for Now" → Done, show success
   - Option B: "Add Purchase Info" → Show purchase form
4. If adding purchase info:
   - User fills in: Store, Price, Currency, Date, Notes
   - User can type new store name (not in dropdown)
   - Submit updates the release with PATCH request
5. Success message includes both release + purchase info saved

**Backend Approach:**
1. **UpdateMusicReleaseDto** enhanced to support:
   ```csharp
   public MusicReleasePurchaseInfoDto? PurchaseInfo { get; set; }
   // Inside PurchaseInfoDto:
   public int? StoreId { get; set; }
   public string? StoreName { get; set; }  // NEW - for creating new store
   ```

2. **Update Logic:**
   - If StoreName provided and StoreId null:
     - Check if store exists (case-insensitive)
     - If exists, use existing ID
     - If not, create new store, get ID
   - Update MusicRelease.PurchaseInfo JSON
   - Transaction ensures atomicity

**User Experience:**
- Low friction: Can skip purchase info entirely
- Can add/edit later via release edit (future feature)
- Clear indication of what's being created ("New store: Record Shop")
- Single success message for entire operation

### Discogs Collection Sync Strategy

Optional feature to add releases to user's Discogs collection after local database save:

**Why Optional Checkbox?**
1. Not all users want releases automatically added to Discogs
2. Some may use Discogs for wishlist/tracking, not ownership
3. Keeps local collection and Discogs collection in sync if desired
4. User has full control over what syncs

**Frontend Flow:**
1. When adding from Discogs search results, show checkbox:
   - "☐ Also add this release to my Discogs collection"
2. User submits release (creates in local database first)
3. **After successful local save:**
   - If checkbox checked AND Discogs authenticated:
     - Call `POST /api/discogs/collection/add`
     - Show loading: "Adding to Discogs..."
     - Show result: "✓ Added!" or "⚠ Failed to add to Discogs"
   - If not authenticated:
     - Show: "Connect Discogs account to sync collection"
4. Continue to purchase info modal regardless of Discogs result
5. Final success includes Discogs status

**Backend Approach:**
1. **New endpoint:** `POST /api/discogs/collection/add`
   ```csharp
   public async Task<ActionResult> AddToDiscogsCollection(
       [FromBody] DiscogsCollectionAddDto dto)
   {
       // dto contains: DiscogsReleaseId, FolderId (optional)
       // Uses user's Discogs token from configuration/user profile
       // Calls Discogs API: POST /users/{username}/collection/folders/{folder_id}/releases/{release_id}
       // Returns success/failure
   }
   ```

2. **Discogs API Authentication:**
   - Requires user Discogs token or OAuth
   - Store in appsettings (dev) or user profile (future)
   - Include in Authorization header for API calls

3. **Error Handling:**
   - 401: User not authenticated with Discogs
   - 404: Release not found on Discogs
   - 422: Already in collection (treat as success)
   - 429: Rate limit exceeded (retry later)
   - 500: Generic Discogs error

4. **Rate Limiting:**
   - Discogs has rate limits (60 requests/minute authenticated)
   - Track requests, handle 429 gracefully
   - Don't block local save if Discogs fails

**Configuration Requirements:**
```json
"Discogs": {
  "Token": "",  // User's Discogs personal access token
  "Username": "",  // User's Discogs username
  "CollectionFolderId": "1"  // Default folder (1 = main collection)
}
```

**Future Enhancements:**
- Multi-user support with per-user Discogs tokens
- OAuth flow for better user experience
- Bulk sync from local → Discogs
- Two-way sync (Discogs → local)
- Folder selection dropdown




### Future Enhancements (Out of Scope)
- [ ] Barcode scanning integration
- [ ] Bulk import from Discogs collection
- [ ] Save drafts for partial entries
- [ ] Image upload from device
- [ ] Advanced search (artist name, album title)
- [ ] Discogs marketplace price lookup
- [ ] Auto-populate from MusicBrainz or other APIs
